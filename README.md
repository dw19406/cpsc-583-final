CPSC 583 Final Project

This project is David Wang's submission for CPSC 583. It combines the Nodeformer and GAT models in an attempt to capture the best of each method while suppressing the problems of each.

To run the program, run the scripts in runner.ipynb. The revised nodeformer can be found in nodeformer.py.
